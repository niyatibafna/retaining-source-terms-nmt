but the difficulties in the way of modernisation were many : lack of funds , particularly foreign exchange ; nonavailability of <REW> machinery </REW> ; opposition from labour arising out of a <REW> fear </REW> of retrenchment .
major exports of india are agricultural products , tea , clothes , jewelery , diamonds , software services , <REW> engineering </REW> products , chemicals and leather . major imports are raw oil , <REW> machinery </REW> , diamonds , fertilizers and chemicals .
this was in addition to rs 125 crores of imports of <REW> machinery </REW> for replacement purposes in the existing industries .
during the years <REW> 1956-61 </REW> , a beginning was made in the production of paper , sugar and <REW> cement </REW> <REW> machinery </REW> and other <REW> engineering </REW> products like compressors .
ensuring plant and <REW> machinery </REW> are safe and that safe systems of work are set and followed ;
the parent industry itself being in infancy , the market for <REW> machinery </REW> was <REW> limited </REW> and private enterprise was not expected to venture into this field .
no sooner did our tv screens light up with images of politicians and army officers greedily accepting bribes than the government ' s propaganda <REW> machinery </REW> went into overdrive to prove this was not about corruption but a conspiracy to destroy a . b . vajpayee ' s uncorrupt government and <REW> yashwant </REW> <REW> sinha </REW> ' s dream budget .

in the industrial <REW> machinery </REW> group , the manufacture of metallurgical equipment may be considered the most important , contributing to the strengthening and diversifying of the country ' s industrial base .
the initial phase of vigorous growth of the <REW> machinery </REW> <REW> sector </REW> came to an end in <REW> 1965-66 </REW> .
in total export of india the majors are agricultural products , tea , clothe , gems and jeweleries , software service , <REW> engineering </REW> goods , chemical and leather . whereas the major imports ares crude oil , <REW> machinery </REW> , precious stones , <REW> fertilizer </REW> and chemical .

the value of <REW> machinery </REW> imports increased from rs <REW> 1.31 </REW> crores in <REW> 1919-20 </REW> to rs 3.67 , rs 7.64 and rs 8.49 crore in the next three years , respectively .

the output of electrical <REW> machinery </REW> increased during <REW> 1961-66 </REW> by 71 per cent , that of other <REW> machinery </REW> by 82 per cent , and of transport equipment by 59 per cent .
instead of taking the trouble to organise a <REW> machinery </REW> for rent collection , they merely sublet their rights to intermediate rent receivers .
one of the most important recommendations of the committee was regarding the <REW> machinery </REW> for transport co-ordination .
the major problems of the industry were shortage of cotton , particularly of the finer variety ; uneconomic size of many units ; urgent need for modernisation of <REW> machinery </REW> and plant ; and proper co-ordination with the handloom sector .
it was particularly against compulsory utilisation of <REW> machinery </REW> of indigenous manufacture .
cost of alterations to and re-conversion of <REW> machinery </REW> was allowed to be treated as revenue expenditure .

the most effective form of counterterrorism fights not the terrorists but the ideas that motivate them . this strategy involves two main steps . first , defeat the islamist movement just as the fascist and <REW> communist </REW> movements were defeated - on every level and in every way , making use of every institution , public and private . this task falls mainly on non-muslims , <REW> muslim </REW> communities being generally incapable or unwilling to purge their own .
