mr. pipes disputes the notion that our enemy is islam by pointing out that there is `` islamist enmity toward muslims .

but that combination has failed this troubled region . the first functional election in the palestinian authority has thrown up hamas . in december , 2005 , the egyptian electorate came out strongly for the muslim brotherhood , a radical islamic party , and not for liberal elements . in iraq , the post-saddam electorate voted in a pro-iranian islamist as prime minister . in lebanon , the voters celebrated the withdrawal of syrian troops by voting hezbollah into the government . likewise , radical islamic elements have prospered in elections in saudi arabia and afghanistan .

in spite of greater use of machinery on the plantations , the organisation of a colliery was less patterned on the lines of the factory system . iron and steel industry
the progress of the major industrial machinery groups is reviewed below .
your driving ability can be affected by just one drink . do not drink before driving , or before using dangerous machinery , or after taking medicine .
but the difficulties in the way of modernisation were many : lack of funds , particularly foreign exchange ; nonavailability of machinery ; opposition from labour arising out of a fear of retrenchment .
major exports of india are agricultural products , tea , clothes , jewelery , diamonds , software services , engineering products , chemicals and leather . major imports are raw oil , machinery , diamonds , fertilizers and chemicals .
this was in addition to rs 125 crores of imports of machinery for replacement purposes in the existing industries .
during the years 1956-61 , a beginning was made in the production of paper , sugar and cement machinery and other engineering products like compressors .
ensuring plant and machinery are safe and that safe systems of work are set and followed ;
the parent industry itself being in infancy , the market for machinery was limited and private enterprise was not expected to venture into this field .
no sooner did our tv screens light up with images of politicians and army officers greedily accepting bribes than the government ' s propaganda machinery went into overdrive to prove this was not about corruption but a conspiracy to destroy a . b . vajpayee ' s uncorrupt government and yashwant sinha ' s dream budget .
in many cases , machinery was not properly or fully used , or it was just left to rust .
co - ordination may be affected by ecstasy , so it could be dangerous to drive or operate machinery under its influence .
in the industrial machinery group , the manufacture of metallurgical equipment may be considered the most important , contributing to the strengthening and diversifying of the country ' s industrial base .
the initial phase of vigorous growth of the machinery sector came to an end in 1965-66 .
in total export of india the majors are agricultural products , tea , clothe , gems and jeweleries , software service , engineering goods , chemical and leather . whereas the major imports ares crude oil , machinery , precious stones , fertilizer and chemical .
the industry could not make much headway during the war because of difficulties of procurement of plant and machinery .
there is adequate capacity in the country for supply of sugar machinery .
all the machinery installed before 1910 needed to be urgently replaced .
apart from its own capacity to meet most of the requirements of textile machinery , it has built a sound ancillary base supplying parts and components .
the value of machinery imports increased from rs 1.31 crores in 1919-20 to rs 3.67 , rs 7.64 and rs 8.49 crore in the next three years , respectively .
a notice must be served on the person responsible for the noise or , in certain circumstances , the owner or occupier of the premises , or the offending vehicle or machinery , etc , or person responsible for the offending vehicle or machinery , etc .
it is expected though that the marxists will unpack their fabled election `` machinery '' pretty early on this time round because of the growing challenge from the trinamool-bjp combine .
among the major bottlenecks in the expansion of the chemicals industry were the shortage of sulphur and the absence of chemicals machinery industry in the country .
to take a simple example , self-sufficiency in cotton textiles may remain an illusion unless the country produces enough cotton of the specified counts ; looms , spindles , other machinery and components , for expansion and replacement ; steel and other materials as also expertise needed for manufacturing such machinery .
the output of electrical machinery increased during 1961-66 by 71 per cent , that of other machinery by 82 per cent , and of transport equipment by 59 per cent .
instead of taking the trouble to organise a machinery for rent collection , they merely sublet their rights to intermediate rent receivers .
one of the most important recommendations of the committee was regarding the machinery for transport co-ordination .
the major problems of the industry were shortage of cotton , particularly of the finer variety ; uneconomic size of many units ; urgent need for modernisation of machinery and plant ; and proper co-ordination with the handloom sector .
it was particularly against compulsory utilisation of machinery of indigenous manufacture .
cost of alterations to and re-conversion of machinery was allowed to be treated as revenue expenditure .

the 1946 report , which i have posted online in pdf format ( warning : it is a large document that may be slow to load ) , is the inaugural issue of a series of weekly reports titled simply intelligence review . this series presents `` current intelligence reflecting the outstanding developments of military interest in the fields of politics , economics , sociology , the technical sciences , and , of course , military affairs . '' chapter headings in this first issue include : `` transition of major powers to peacetime military systems , '' `` manchuria
2 as with our previous reports , we based our recommendations on extensive research and consultation .
the issue reached new heights of tension in recent weeks , despite an ankara-baghdad agreement requiring that iraqi troops crack down on the pkk and unconfirmed reports of a u.&space;s. special forces covert operation against the pkk . with syrian president bashar al-assad ' s support , erdoÄŸan has waved away american concerns about a turkish invasion , the turkish parliament voted 507-19 to authorize air strikes and ground invasions of iraq , and chief of staff yaÅŸar bÃ¼yÃ¼kanÄ±t made bellicose threats .
these minor adjustments prompted howls internationally - with european and u . n . reports condemning denmark for racism and `` islamophobia , '' the washington post reporting that muslim immigrants `` face habitual discrimination , '' and a london guardian headline announcing that `` copenhagen flirts with fascism .

should these reports be true ( and it bears noting that prior such statements had little operational effect ) , they imply either the handover of unarmed ashraf residents to iraqi forces or their expulsion to iran . in either case , a full-scale slaughter , whether by tehran 's proxies in iraq or by tehran itself , appears likely . inspired by such a success , tehran 's ambitions in iraq would undoubtedly grow further .

this british disinformation campaign had two disastrous implications for world war ii . first , it prompted the allied public to be skeptical concerning german atrocities against jews , which bore a close resemblance to the imaginary horrors the british had disseminated , so that reports from nazi-occupied territories were regularly discounted .

the most effective form of counterterrorism fights not the terrorists but the ideas that motivate them . this strategy involves two main steps . first , defeat the islamist movement just as the fascist and communist movements were defeated - on every level and in every way , making use of every institution , public and private . this task falls mainly on non-muslims , muslim communities being generally incapable or unwilling to purge their own .
in the circumstances , a left consolidation committee was formed with the forward bloc , the congress socialist party , the radical democratic party of m . n . roy and national front - lrb - as the communists called themselves at that time - rrb - with subhas chandra as chairman .
any socialist or communist , who pays lip service to non-violence and acts differently , does injury to his ideals and makes people think that his acts do not conform to his professions .

various studies have shown that esperanto is useful as a preparation for learning other languages .
the aims that inspire the users of esperanto are still as important and relevant as ever .
in the esperanto community , however , language diversity is experienced as a constant and indispensable source of enrichment .
we , members of the worldwide movement for the promotion of esperanto , address this manifesto to all governments , international organizations and people of good will ; declare our unshakeable commitment to the objectives set out here ; and call on all organizations and individuals to join us in working for these goals .
the esperanto community is almost unique as a worldwide community whose members are universally bilingual or multilingual .

while esperanto , like any language , is not perfect , it far outstrips other languages as a means of egalitarian communication on a world scale .
